          </h3>

          <p class="marg-bot-0">
            The Metric is a student-run organization that publishes content related to global current events. We empower university-aged contributors from around the world to share their unique perspectives and stories that may not be heard outside of their local communities. We represent a variety of geographic locations, cultural experiences, and intellectual interests—we are united by a passion to provide a better measure of what’s happening around the world.
            <br><br>
            Our platform is a tool for enabling our generation to share their stories with the world. We believe that our diversity of contributors produces a better measure of what’s happening in the world. With this in mind, we provide insights on what matters with the context the modern world demands.
            <br><br>
            In addition to our published content, we highlight opportunities and resources to catalyze political action. Being informed matters to the extent that we use our knowledge to make the world a better place, which makes us strive to connect our readers with the means to engage with their communities across the world.
