      <h1 class="special">Welcome to TheMetric!</h1>
      <h3 class="bold text-muted">Here's a guide to helping you contribute, get started, and help us grow.</h3>

      <div class="line-1"></div>

      <p class="serif">
        First and foremost, keep everyone updated on your progress on <a href="https://themetricteam.slack.com">Slack.</a> It's important everyone is in the loop so that we can push out everything in sync (edits, shares, publications, etc.).
      </p>

      <p class="serif">
        If you ever have any questions, read through this guide and ask in Slack if you are still unsure.
      </p>

      <h3 class="bold">
        Getting your account up and running
      </h3>

      <p class="serif">
        If you haven't yet, <%= link_to 'edit your account information', edit_admin_path(current_admin) %> so that our readers know who you are. Every article you write will come up under your name and people will see your articles when they go to your <%= link_to 'account page.', current_admin %>
      </p>

      <div class="space-1"></div>

      <h3 class="bold">
        Writing and submitting an article for review
      </h3>

      <p class="serif">
        Articles can be written and submitted <%= link_to 'here.', new_article_path %> Importantly, the body of the article is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown language.</a> You can read a userful guide on getting started with markdown <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">here.</a> Markdown is a simple text markup language which makes it easy to add basic styles to text (different header sizes, bold, itallics, underlined, spacing, images, links, etc.).
      </p>

      <div class="space-1"></div>

      <h3 class="bold">
        Publishing an article to the public
      </h3>

      <p class="serif">
        Not everyone has permissions to publish an article (yes, not even your own). This is a precaution put in to ensure that only the right content reaches our readers. If you do not have these permissions and you think your article is ready to be shipped, reach out to the executive board memebers on Slack.
      </p>

      <p class="serif">
        The same people who can publish articles can also unpublish articles, thereby removing them from public view.
      </p>

        Adding contributors to TheMetric
      </h3>

      <p class="serif">
        Anyone who is a super admin has the ability to refer users by email addresses to join the platform. Only users with "referred" email addresses can successfully register on the platform. This is a check to ensure that only people we want can contribute on this platform.
